2. Drag the desired center of gravitation Gameobject to the "Orbject to Orbit Around" slot.
3. Edit Parameters:
     ·Object Looks at Center: With this option, your orbiting Gameobject will always
                              look at the center of gravitation (Object to Orbit Around).
						      *Z Axis is the one that will point to the center of Gravitation.
     ·Dist to Orbit center: Enter the distance from the orbit center.
	 ·Orbit Speed: Enter the orbit speed (Enter negative values to orbit the opposite direction).
	 ·Inclination: From -1 to 1, select the inclination value which will set the Orbiter object
	               in a spherical radius height regarding the center (-1 on the top, 1 on the bottom)
	 ·Up and Down: Sets an "up and down" movement while orbitting regarding the Inclination parameter
	 ·Up and Down Speed: Sets the "up and down" movement speed
