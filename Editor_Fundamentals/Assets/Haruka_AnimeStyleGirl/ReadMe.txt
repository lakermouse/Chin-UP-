---->   How to Use in URP Project ？<------

I Use UTS2（Unity-Chan Toon Shader Ver2）in this Project

There is a URP package in“URP”   Folder

By expanding the URP package data , it can be overwritten and converted to URP compatible material.

This URP package is a full URP project ，so  you can also Import this URP package into a new URP project.

URP Project use UTS Universal 2.5.0.

Of course you can also use other shader instead of UTS2 like I do in Sample Image !~


---------> About Physical Simulation <-----------


The skirt and dress do not use extra bone

So if you want to Use Physical Simulation On skirt and dress ,You need to use the Cloth simulation plug-in

I use "Magica Cloth" in the video, You can find it on AssetStore.

Of course you can also use other plug-ins to achieve similar result.


------------ Any other questions-----------------

If you find any problems while using it, 

you can contact me and I will reply to you as soon as possible.
